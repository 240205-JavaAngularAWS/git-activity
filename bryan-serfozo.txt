Hey my name is Bryan Serfozo and I have a few fun facts! Looking forward to reading y'all's!

1. I just bought my first house this past summer!

2. I've done karate since I was a kid and have had the opportunity to compete overseas twice for the U.S. Team.

3. I actually managed to receive my first college degree before graduating high school! (In fact, due to birthday timing, I actually graduated college at 17, but high school at 18)
